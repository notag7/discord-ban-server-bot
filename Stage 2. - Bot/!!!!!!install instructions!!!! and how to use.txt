1. Install all requirements:

-Download python

-run the following commands: 

pip install discord

pip install discord.ext

pip install datetime

pip install asyncio



2. Get your Bot token (yes this time a bot token)


3. Fill in the bot token into the file and copy the userids.txt to this folder. 

4. Run the python file and wait until the bot starts.

5 Use the +banall command (if you havent changed it) 

6. Wait untill the bot is done. 

Note: The speed of the process can be very slow when there are a lot of users in the server, also your bot maybe gets timeouted by discord, then you have to increase the number on line 26.
